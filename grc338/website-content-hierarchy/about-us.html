                <p> It is the goal of the Subvert gallery to make art accessible for everyone and connect like-minded artists, art-buyers, and art lovers alike. </p>
                
                <p>“Ultimately, I want to change the way people view art, the way people buy art, the way they make art. I’ve always tried to balance the tight rope of making my art accessible to those who are aware of the craft, and those who aren’t convinced of art or more specifically my artistic objective. I believe that concealing too much in theory is problematic and that art can function in every day life. I strive for an artistic legacy that confluences and impacts all cultures.” </p>
