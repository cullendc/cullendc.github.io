            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <h3>Cortex Magazine </h3><!--Change it to the name of the company-->
            
            <p>Science is often presented in media in two distinct ways: either as goofy and juvenile, like Bill Nye and Mythbusters, or as overly complex and indigestible, like the works of Stephen Hawking and Michio Kaku. My goal with Cortex Magazine is to strike a balance between these extremes. I don't want to simply present fun facts, nor do I want to delve into dense dissertations. Instead, I draw inspiration from RadioLab, a podcast that masterfully blends hard science with engaging narratives and emotional depth. RadioLab constructs stories that not only highlight the thrill of scientific discovery but also capture the compelling human emotions involved in the process.

                Cortex Magazine will cater to a mature audience aged 15 and above, maintaining an informal, artistic, and visually appealing aesthetic. I want the graphics and photography to captivate readers as much as the intriguing headlines do. The design will tease the boundaries of traditional magazine layouts while remaining accessible and recognizable. By adapting RadioLab’s conversational format, I aim to create a sense of shared discovery, where readers feel like they are learning alongside the host. This approach will foster a sense of agency, as readers find themselves asking the same questions and experiencing the same revelations as the hosts. </p><!--Short description of the magazine-->
